### An overview in Tourette Syndrome and Obsessive-Compulsive disorder

## Answers to questions on the peer review sheets

1. What stage is the study currently- enrolling patients? Submitting for approval? Data already collected 
and waiting to be analyzed?

The patients are being continuously enrolled in various projects. Majority of my lab does psychological and 
epidemiological research. I am doing genetic research on a portion of the patients diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome.
Data for these individuals has been collected, samples were collected and sent for sequencing/genotyping mid March, 
I have gotten back 2/3 of the data end of March which I'm now processing and analyzing. The last 1/3 will probably be 
processed after the COVID-19 pandemic eases enough for BROAD Institute to sturt running the queues again.

2. Other co-variates associated with these psychiatric disorders: race, SES, nationality?

Whether or not an individual will be diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome or Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is definitely 
affected by the slew of extrinsic factors including race, SES, and nationality. Particularly, Touretty Syndrome is a 
neurodevelopmental disorder, so it's not generally thought of as a trauma-induced disorder. In fact, its rare even among 
people suffering physical brain injury. Now, Tourette Syndrome has a quite high heritability rate, estimates go up to 80%, which
suggests a strong genetic component. Since I'm looking at individuals with positive diagnosis and comparing them to individuals
without diagnosis - these extrinsic factors are not of great concern. However, epidemiologically, the understanding of tic
disorders including Tourette's syndrome would certaily benefit from awareness regarding effects of extrinsic variables, 
including access to mental health services.

3. OCD- 30% heritability. How was that determined? Are there any behavioral animall models for any of these disorders? Of 
the known genes associated with psychiatric disorders, have any of them been modeled in animals?

Heritability is statistically defined as the proportion of phenotypic variance attributable to genetic variance. In orther 
words, it's how much genetics contribute to differences in observed behaviors. Due to this definition, heritability is a 
proportion and its value can be expressed in percentages. Now heritability vs. environmentality are relatively abstract and 
quite interacting concepts, particualrly when it comes to polygenic and non-Mendelian phenotypes, so their estimates should 
considered carefully. There are many caveates for using the heritability estimate, however it is certainly one of the most
useful measures to understand familial aggregation of disorders. Heritability is estimated through varius models, but a lot 
of times in psychology monozygotic twins (reared apart and together) are used to get such an estimate. Usually, the models
are based on multigenerational data and, particularly, twin studies. Here is a good [paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrg3377) 
on heritability, and a [paper](https://www.dialogues-cns.org/wp-content/uploads/issues/12/DialoguesClinNeurosci-12-149.pdf) 
from which I retrieved the OCD heritability rate.

Yes, there are some animal models for Tourette Syndrome, but most are actually modelling tics and tic disorders. There is an
entire [issue of Journal of Neuroscience Methods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-neuroscience-methods/vol/292/suppl/C) 
dedicated to animal models of Tourette Syndrome and associated disorders. One thing I would like to note, however, is that 
psychiatric disorders are often disturbances in complex human behavioral trait, this makes them relatively hard to study in 
standard animal models such as mice and zebrafish. In the field of psychology, scoientists usually use monkeys or apes due to
their evolutionary proximity and behavior complexity. That said, various Tourette Syndrome associated genes have been perturbed
in mice, and their effects studied. Some of these include:
- [_CNTNAP2_](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnmol.2018.00262): knockout mice showed down-regulation of pervalbumin, a 
protein known to be a common thread in various models of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Note, however, that this mouse has not 
been studied in the cotext of Tourette Syndrome.
- [_HDC_](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2015.03.067): knockout mice were found to show tic-like stereotypies, deficit in 
prepulse inhibition (neurologic phenomenon in which a nonstartling prestimulus attenuates the response to a subsequent strong 
startling stimulus), dysregulated dopaminergic innervation of the basal ganglia, also the tics in mice can be mitigated by the 
same type of antagonists used as pharmacotherapy for Tourette Syndrome.
- [_SLITRK1_](https://doi.org/10.1038/mp.2008.97): knockout mice showed elevated anxiety-like behaviors, increased immobility 
times in mobility tests,  increased levels of norepinephrine and its metabolite MHPG. Administration of Î±2-adrenergic agonist
also used to treat Tourette Syndrome has resulted in attenuated the anxiety-like behavior of knockout mice.
- [_CNTN6_](https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.969): knockout mice experienced changes in spatial learning and memory, however no
Tourette Syndrome related phenotypes were observed in the study.
- [_NRXN1A_](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0067114): knockout mice showed altered social approach, reduced social 
investigation, and reduced locomotor activity in novel environments. Male mice demonstrated an increase in aggressive 
behaviours.
-[_D1CT-7_](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2017.01.009): knockout mice recapitulate the exhibit abnormal sensorimotor 
integration and gait found in Tourette Syndrome patients.
