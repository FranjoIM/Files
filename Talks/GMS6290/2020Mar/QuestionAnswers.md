## Answers to questions on the peer review sheets

1. What stage is the study currently- enrolling patients? Submitting for approval? Data already collected 
and waiting to be analyzed?

The patients are being continuously enrolled in various projects. Majority of my lab does psychological and 
epidemiological research. I am doing genetic research on a portion of the patients diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome.
Data for these individuals has been collected, samples were collected and sent for sequencing/genotyping mid March, 
I have gotten back 2/3 of the data end of March which I'm now processing and analyzing. The last 1/3 will probably be 
processed after the COVID-19 pandemic eases enough for BROAD Institute to sturt running the queues again.

2. Other co-variates associated with these psychiatric disorders: race, SES, nationality?

Whether or not an individual will be diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome or Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is definitely 
affected by the slew of extrinsic factors including race, SES, and nationality. Particularly, Touretty Syndrome is a 
neurodevelopmental disorder, so it's not generally thought of as a trauma-induced disorder. In fact, its rare even among 
people suffering physical brain injury. Now, Tourette Syndrome has a quite high heritability rate, estimates go up to 80%, which
suggests a strong genetic component. Since I'm looking at individuals with positive diagnosis and comparing them to individuals
without diagnosis - these extrinsic factors are not of great concern. However, epidemiologically, the understanding of tic
disorders including Tourette's syndrome would certaily benefit from awareness regarding effects of extrinsic variables, 
including access to mental health services.

3. OCD- 30% heritability. How was that determined? Are there any behavioral animall models for any of these disorders? Of 
the known genes associated with psychiatric disorders, have any of them been modeled in animals?

Heritability is statistically defined as the proportion of phenotypic variance attributable to genetic variance. In orther 
words, it's how much genetics contribute to differences in observed behaviors. Due to this definition, heritability is a 
proportion and its value can be expressed in percentages. Now heritability vs. environmentality are relatively abstract and 
quite interacting concepts, particualrly when it comes to polygenic and non-Mendelian phenotypes, so their estimates should 
considered carefully. There are many caveates for using the heritability estimate, however it is certainly one of the most
useful measures to understand familial aggregation of disorders. Heritability is estimated through varius models, but a lot 
of times in psychology monozygotic twins (reared apart and together) are used to get such an estimate. Usually, the models
are based on multigenerational data and, particularly, twin studies. Here is a good [paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrg3377) 
on heritability, and a [paper](https://www.dialogues-cns.org/wp-content/uploads/issues/12/DialoguesClinNeurosci-12-149.pdf) 
from which I retrieved the OCD heritability rate.

Yes, there are some animal models for Tourette Syndrome, but most are actually modelling tics and tic disorders. There is an
entire [issue of Journal of Neuroscience Methods](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-neuroscience-methods/vol/292/suppl/C) 
dedicated to animal models of Tourette Syndrome and associated disorders. One thing I would like to note, however, is that 
psychiatric disorders are often disturbances in complex human behavioral trait, this makes them relatively hard to study in 
standard animal models such as mice and zebrafish. In the field of psychology, scoientists usually use monkeys or apes due to
their evolutionary proximity and behavior complexity. That said, various Tourette Syndrome associated genes have been perturbed
in mice, and their effects studied. Some of these include:
- [_CNTNAP2_](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnmol.2018.00262): knockout mice showed down-regulation of pervalbumin, a 
protein known to be a common thread in various models of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Note, however, that this mouse has not 
been studied in the cotext of Tourette Syndrome.
- [_HDC_](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2015.03.067): knockout mice were found to show tic-like stereotypies, deficit in 
prepulse inhibition (neurologic phenomenon in which a nonstartling prestimulus attenuates the response to a subsequent strong 
startling stimulus), dysregulated dopaminergic innervation of the basal ganglia, also the tics in mice can be mitigated by the 
same type of antagonists used as pharmacotherapy for Tourette Syndrome.
- [_SLITRK1_](https://doi.org/10.1038/mp.2008.97): knockout mice showed elevated anxiety-like behaviors, increased immobility 
times in mobility tests,  increased levels of norepinephrine and its metabolite MHPG. Administration of α2-adrenergic agonist
also used to treat Tourette Syndrome has resulted in attenuated the anxiety-like behavior of knockout mice.
- [_CNTN6_](https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.969): knockout mice experienced changes in spatial learning and memory, however no
Tourette Syndrome related phenotypes were observed in the study.
- [_NRXN1A_](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0067114): knockout mice showed altered social approach, reduced social 
investigation, and reduced locomotor activity in novel environments. Male mice demonstrated an increase in aggressive 
behaviours.
-[_D1CT-7_](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2017.01.009): knockout mice recapitulate the exhibit abnormal sensorimotor 
integration and gait found in Tourette Syndrome patients.

4. I read a while ago that for some psychiatric disorders there are significant differences between males and females and how they show symptoms (which you mentioned!) which causes a misdiagnosis in women because most of the general studies were done in men. Do you know if this can happen in the disorders you are studying?

5. Have any GWAS been done before for these diseases? Have any genes been identified as possible candidates before?

6. Is there a race dependent difference in frequency and age of onset for Tourette’s?

7. If it is a hereditary condition, based on the phenotypic data obtained, do we know its mode of inheritance? (autosomal dominant/recessive?

8. Do you think there could be different genetic abnormalities that could manifest as Tourette’s? (one such thing I read about was a mutation in SLITRK1 gene which is not present in all patients)

9. Are acquired mental disorders such as PTSD the result of epigenetic changes in the genome? Could bisulfite sequencing be used to identify differentially-methylated genes associated with these disorders

10. Is part of the goal of psychiatric genetics to reduce subjectivity/bias in diagnoses by creating models based on associated polymorphisms, creating confidence estimates for a patient having a particular mental disorder?

11. Does the Costa Rican sample being used for this study have a different rate of diagnosis of Tourette’s Syndrome or OCD compared to other populations?

12. What has other GWAS studies found about psychological disorders?

13. Are there any environmental or demographic variable that you are not able to control for? What are they?

14. Are you predicting any other diseases would be genetically similar to each other in a manner like OCD and Tourette’s, i.e. dementia and Alzheimer’s?

15. What, if any, brain morphological differences have been found amongst psychiatric disorders?

16. How extensive is the demographic and phenotypic data collected?

17. Will you be able to do splicing analysis on WES?

18. How can you classify Tourette’s as psychiatric disease? Is it not more nervous system related?

19. Is there any evidence to show that Psychiatric disorders are inherited in a Mendelian way?

20. How long do you think pedigree construction for 15 generations will take?

21. Is there any publicly accessible dataset for psychiatric disorders like the web for cancer?

22. What would be the standard clinical test for these psychiatric disorders?

23. For the samples your collect for GWAS, what would be the distribution of disorders, sex, age, nationalities and etc.?

24. Why are psychiatric disorders commonly comorbid? Do certain disorders lead to other psychiatric symptoms because of anxiety and/or social stigma?

25. Why do you think the gender differences in OCD prevalence flip between childhood and adulthood?

26. Do you think whole exome sequencing may be too narrow in scope for identification of rare mutations? Is there evidence that any promoter or enhancer level polymorphisms are associated with psychiatric disorders?

27. With so many comorbidities, between so many neurological conditions, are there any already known genetic factors that could be causing a chunk of those conditions?

28. Was there a consistent diagnosis criteria set for both disorders (accepted framework; did doctors primarily use DSM-5 to make confident diagnoses)?

29. What’s the potential reason for different sex preference?

30. When you collect patient data, what kind of the background information will you consider?

31. Have you considered the kinship for the GWAS data? What method you used for the analysis, regression or chi-square tests?

32. How many samples you will use to do the association analysis? Have you evaluate your statistical power for that sample size?

33. When you obtain your phenotype data from different psychiatrists, have you considered the phenotypic data bias from different sources?

34. The investigators who re-assess the results – are they a mixture of different ethnicities/age/gender, to reduce bias?

35. Is there data collected for OCD also that you will be analyzing for just for Tourette’s syndrome? Plus, do you take into consideration the range of severity, socio-economic/relationship status etc that can act as triggers for each case (esp for OCD)?

36. How much is known about the molecular mechanisms of these diseases?

37. Are there similar GWAS methods that have been in similar psychiatric genetics?

38. Is there any trigger for onset of Tourette’s Syndrome or is it a gradual onset?

39. Are there any plans for follow-up experiments for interesting results that come from the CNV and GWAS analyses?

40. What methods are you looking at for the CNV analysis?

41. Do patients with Tourette’s have any learning disabilities or correlation with lower IQs?

42. Do you have genetic information for the siblings of these patients?

43. Are you going to be comparing your Costa Rican pedigree to preexisting pedigrees to see if this matches well, or if this population bias is affecting your overall results?

44. Why are males typically more effected by Tourette’s Disorder than females?

45. Why is the onset of TS occur before the age of 18?

46. Why is the onset of OCD in females occur in adulthood and in children in men?

47. For the Illumina Global Screen Array, how are you going to think of previously reported balanced aberrations that don’t show up on CNV analysis?

48. Is LOH included in the analysis?

49. With OCD and other diseases, are there any hotspot locations where these problems are prevalent? Is Costa rica one such place?

50. When you say that untreated OCD becomes chronic, does this mean they worsen over time, treatment becomes ineffective or are they predisposed to develop new behavioral issues?

51. You mentioned that OCD is chronic if untreated, what is the current treatment to deal with OCD and how does it work?

52. Are the questionnaires the main way to diagnose the disorders? If so, is it only a self-questionnaire or does it incorporate close family/friends?

53. Does your sample population include any people that may have had one of these disorders earlier in development that may have waned as they got older?

54. What methods are you using for GWAS?

55. You mentioned a specific population that is being focused on, do they share criteria for diagnosis with other populations?

56. Are genetic markers well characterized for OCD? Or is it more environmentally triggered?

57. Is it known how compulsive tendencies can separate out into different manifestations (ie. OCD vs hoarding)?

58. Do you think reproducibility issues will be a major concern for your project?

59. What are the hypothesis’ for what transcriptomics would show for psychiatric disorders?

60. How difficult is it to ensure your diagnoses are true and how much of a burden is it if they are incorrectly diagnosed?

61. How much of a concern that using Costa Rican data could narrow your results for only that region?
